What have I programmed?

This is a Python code that uses a microphone to record audio and then uses Google's speech recognition technology to convert the speech in the audio into text. The text is then saved to a file.


Why did I build it?

The pursuit of learning a new language is an admirable goal, and one that can be challenging without the right resources. As someone who desired to learn Italian, I encountered difficulties with using Google Translate to decipher English translations from an Italian book. The need to input specific Italian phrases in order to receive their English counterparts was a hurdle that impeded my progress.

To circumvent this obstacle, I utilized my programming skills to create a solution. I developed a program that could listen to me read the Italian book aloud and subsequently translate the text into English. This allowed me to focus on learning the Italian language without being hampered by language barriers or the intricacies of translation software.

The beauty of programming is that it empowers individuals to create solutions to real-world problems. I found it personally satisfying to apply my skills to address a practical issue and help facilitate my language learning journey.
